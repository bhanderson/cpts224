	ln realfile hardlink
	ln -s realfile softlink
	cp realfile filecopy

before:
	-rw-r--r--  1 bhanderson  staff  0 Sep 22 10:15 filecopy
	-rw-r--r--  2 bhanderson  staff  0 Sep 22 10:14 hardlink
	-rw-r--r--  2 bhanderson  staff  0 Sep 22 10:14 realfile
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 bhanderson  staff  8 Sep 22 10:15 softlink -> realfile
after:
	-rw-r--r--  1 bhanderson  staff  0 Sep 22 10:15 filecopy
	-rw-r--r--  2 bhanderson  staff  3 Sep 22 10:17 hardlink
	-rw-r--r--  2 bhanderson  staff  3 Sep 22 10:17 realfile
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 bhanderson  staff  8 Sep 22 10:15 softlink -> realfile
3.
	1550319 filecopy 1550287 hardlink 1550287 realfile 1550318 softlink
4.
	filecopy: empty
	hardlink: ASCII text
	realfile: ASCII text
	softlink: symbolic link in a loop
	-- the softlink is a link while the rest are treated as files with filecopy
		being empty
5.
	chmod 770 hardlink
6.
	before it was -rw-r--r-- now it is -rwxrwx--- because there is not difference
		when editing hardlink it is treated as realfile
7.
	each file is the same except filecopy which is empty
8.
	hardlink and realfile's size increased while softlink stayed the size of a link
9.
	The file was just renamed and the inode stayed the same
